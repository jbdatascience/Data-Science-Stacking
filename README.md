# Data Science Stacking

Binary prediction classification using the popular Titanic data set from Kaggle.  This is interesting as it is my first 
attempt at stacking classifiers.  I get decent performance, 0.8547 accuracy, on my validation set.  The Titanic data set 
is a bit tricky because it is so small.
